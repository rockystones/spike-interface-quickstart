# spike-interface-quickstart
My quick start on using the spike interface project 

It's an incredible project with tremendous effort, the documentation is nice and detailed, but still, it is a little daunting for graduate students to start learning about it on their own without the help of experienced users, especially when we are not very coding savvy. 

The hope of this quick start is the same as the "hello world!" when you are starting to learn coding. 

Documenting my exploration with the project so others can learn from my experience.
